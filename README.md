A servo motor is a rotary actuator or a motor that allows for a precise control in terms of the angular position, acceleration, and velocity. Basically it has certain capabilities that a regular motor does not have. Consequently it makes use of a regular motor and pairs it with a sensor for position feedback .

The servo motor is most commonly used for high technology devices in the industrial applications like automation technology. It is a self contained electrical device, 
that rotates parts of machine with high efficiency and great precision. 
Moreover the output shaft of this motor can be moved to a particular angle. Servo motors are mainly used in home electronics, toys, cars, airplanes and many more devices.
